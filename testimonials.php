                                Hi, Shirodkar here. Before submitting my feedback, I would like to state that I am a retired Assistant General Manager of the State Bank of India and am still working as a Consultant (Finance). During my journey of 41 years in a Bank and as a consultant for 17 years, I had exposure to several seminars and study lectures. But I never came across a presentation such as Dr. Khankhoje's. He gave a presentation today on STRESS MANAGEMENT.
                                <span class="read-more" onclick="toggleText(this)">Read More...</span>
                                <span class="full-text" style="display: none;"> It was unique since his presentation skills kept the audience glued to the screen. I am confident that the contents of the presentation are an eye-opener and worth emulating. The visualization effects would leave an indelible mark on the participants and encourage them in their daily chores. I wish Dr. Khankhoje all the best in his future endeavors.</span>

It is here that we need a life coach like Dr. Prashant to highlight these aspects which need to be worked upon to help us grow in these areas. A periodic review could be useful not only in business but also in other dimensions of our life.</p>
